NOTES:

1.  self.prompt = prompt must be of type bytes
    self.prompt = prompt.encode('utf-8')

2. There is a challenge, because we don't know how long it will take for TestBench to finalize filling
   in the input buffer.
   I had to play with some delay times: time.sleep(0.02)
   May have to change (increase) this time in the future
   I tested it by reading very long memory values and with this value it worked.

3. Before each send MUST reset the input buffer. this is in case if we are sending two send commands back to back
   and then perform a response() operation.
   The old version always read back everything and emptied the input buffer.
   The new version doesn't do that. So if I issue back to back send commands and if I don't empty the
   input buffer, the first response() command will still have responses from the very first send(), with
   a string that terminates with a '\r'. This is causing the respond() to stop there and it will never reach
   the data that it needs. 
   
   Two possible solutions:
   a) after each send, process the response(), which will empty the input buffer
   b) must reset the input buffer before each send, to clear up the garbage of the previous send

   I am thinking to change that: possibly to a)
